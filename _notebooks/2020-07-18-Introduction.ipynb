You may want to split them randomly, by certain indices or depending on the folder they are in. You can have your labels in your csv file or your dataframe, but it may come from folders or a specific function of the input. You may choose to add data augmentation or not. A test set is optional too. Finally you have to set the arguments to put the data together in a DataBunch (batch size, collate function...)\n",

    "The data block API is called as such because you can mix and match each one of those blocks with the others, allowing for a total flexibility to create your customized DataBunch for training, validation and testing. The factory methods of the various DataBunch are great for beginners but you can't always make your data fit in the tracks they require."
